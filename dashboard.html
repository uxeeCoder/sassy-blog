          <h2>What is SaSS</h2>
          <p>
            SASS stands for "Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets." It's a
            preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into
            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). SASS extends CSS with features like
            variables, nested rules, mixins, and functions, which make CSS more
            maintainable and easier to write. With SASS, you can write CSS in a
            more structured and efficient way, reducing redundancy and improving
            organization. It's commonly used in web development projects to
            streamline the styling process and make CSS code more manageable.

          <h2>How SaSS Works</h2>
          <p>
            Certainly! SASS provides several powerful features that enhance the
            capabilities of traditional CSS. Here's a deeper description of some
            key functionalities:
          </p>
          <p>
            Variables: SASS allows you to define variables to store reusable
            values such as colors, font sizes, or any other CSS value. This
            makes it easy to maintain consistency throughout your stylesheets
            and quickly update values across multiple rules.
          </p>
          <pre>
 
                $primary-color: #007bff;
                $font-size-medium: 16px;
                
                .button {
                background-color: $primary-color;
                font-size: $font-size-medium;
                }
            </pre
          >
          <p>
            Nesting: SASS allows you to nest CSS selectors within one another,
            providing a more hierarchical structure to your styles. This can
            improve readability and reduce repetition in your code.
          </p>
          <pre>
            .container {
              width: 100%;
              
              .header {
              font-size: 24px;}
              
              .content {
              padding: 20px;
            }}
        </pre
          >
          <p>
            Mixins: Mixins allow you to define reusable blocks of styles that
            can be included in multiple selectors. This is particularly useful
            for vendor prefixes, media queries, or any other repeated patterns
            in your CSS.
          </p>
          <pre>
            @mixin border-radius($radius) {
                -webkit-border-radius: $radius;
                -moz-border-radius: $radius;
                border-radius: $radius;
              }
              
              .box {
                @include border-radius(5px);
                background-color: #f0f0f0;
              }
              
        </pre
          >
          <p>
            Functions: SASS supports the creation of custom functions, which can
            accept arguments and return values. This allows for more dynamic and
            flexible stylesheets.
          </p>
          <pre>
   @function calculate-width($container-width, $column-count, $gutter) {
      @return ($container-width / $column-count) - $gutter;
    }
          
    .column {
      width: calculate-width(1000px, 3, 20px);
    }
       </pre
          >
          <p>
            Partials and Import: SASS allows you to break your stylesheets into
            smaller, modular files called partials. These partials can then be
            imported into other SASS files, facilitating better organization and
            maintainability of your codebase.
          </p>
          <pre>
// _variables.scss
$primary-color: #007bff;
$font-size-medium: 16px;

// main.scss
@import 'variables';

.button {
background-color: $primary-color;
font-size: $font-size-medium;
}

          <h2>BEM Naming Convention</h2>
          <p>
            BEM stands for Block, Element, Modifier. It's a popular naming
            convention for writing CSS and Sass code in a modular and
            maintainable way, especially when working with large-scale projects
            or teams. Here's a brief overview of each part of the BEM naming
            convention:
          </p>

          <h3>Block (block):</h3>
          <p>
            The top-level abstraction or component that represents a standalone
            entity on the page. Blocks can be thought of as parent components.
          </p>
          <h3>Element (block__element):</h3>
          <p>
            A part of the block that has no standalone meaning and is
            semantically tied to its block. Elements are separated from the
            block name by two underscores (__). They are components that exist
            within a block.
          </p>
          <h3>Modifier (block--modifier or block__element--modifier):</h3>
          <p>
            A flag on a block or element that changes its appearance or
            behavior. Modifiers are separated from the block or element name by
            two dashes (--) or (__).
          </p>
          <p>
            Using BEM in Sass involves naming your CSS classes according to this
            convention. Here's an example of how you might use BEM in Sass:
          </p>
          <pre>
.navbar {
  background-color: #333;
  &__item {
    display: inline-block;
    &--active {
      color: red; // Modifier
    }
  }
}

</pre
          >
          <p>
            In this example: .navbar is a block. .navbar__item is an element of
            the .navbar block. .navbar__item--active is a modifier of the
            .navbar__item element. This helps in writing modular and
            maintainable CSS/Sass code because it clearly defines the
            relationship between various components on the page and makes it
            easier to understand and manage the styling of individual elements.
          </p>

          <h2>7-1 Folder Structure</h2>
          <p>
            In Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets), the 7-1 pattern is a
            popular architecture for organizing stylesheets in large projects.
            It's a way to modularize and organize your Sass code for better
            maintainability and scalability. The "7" in the name refers to the
            seven different directories or folders, while the "1" refers to a
            single main file that imports all the partials. Here's a breakdown
            of the structure:
          </p>
          <h3>Base:</h3>
          <p>
            Contains the boilerplate code, such as resets, typography, and base
            styles.
          </p>

          <h3>Components:</h3>
          <p>Holds specific UI components, each in its own partial file.</p>
          <h3>Layout:</h3>
          <p>
            Deals with the overall layout of the project, like header, footer,
            sidebar, grid systems, etc.
          </p>
          <h3>Pages:</h3>
          <p>
            Contains page-specific styles. Each page of the website or
            application has its own partial.
          </p>

          <h3>Themes:</h3>
          <p>
            Houses styles related to different themes if your project supports
            them.
          </p>
          <h3>Utils:</h3>
          <p>Contains utilities and helper classes.</p>
          <h3>Vendors:</h3>
          <p>
            Holds third-party CSS or Sass files, such as libraries or
            frameworks.
          </p>
          <p>And then, there's the "main" file:</p>
          <h3>main.scss or styles.scss:</h3>
          <p>
            This is the main Sass file that imports all the partials from the
            above directories and compiles into a single CSS file.
          </p>
          <p>
            This structure helps in organizing your codebase, making it easier
            to find and maintain styles, and encourages modularity and
            reusability.
